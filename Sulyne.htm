<h1><strong>What is Lorem Ipsum</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br>
industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br>scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br>
electronic type setting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br> 
Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like<br>
<i><strong> <u>Aldus PageMaker</u></strong></i> including versions of <u>Lorem Ipsum</u>. 1914 translation by H. Rackham
</p>
<p align = "justify"> But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was<br>
born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue <br>
pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone<br>
who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally<br>
circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. </p>

<h2><strong> Why do we use it?</strong></h2>
<p> 
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its<br>
layout. The point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br>
using <q>Content here, content here</q>, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and <br>
web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for <q>lorem Ipsum</q> will uncover<br> 
many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> 
sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</br>
</p>

<h3><strong>Where can I get some?</strong></h3>
<p>
  <strong>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
  alteration in some form, by injected humour, or <u>randomized words</u> which don't look even slightly
  believable.</strong> If you <br>are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything 
embarrassing hidden in the<br> middle of text. <i>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat 
predefined chunks as necessary,<br> making this the first true generator on the Internet.</i> It uses a dictionary of over 
200 Latin words, combined with<br> a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks 
reasonable. The generated Lorem <br
>Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non characteristic words etc.
